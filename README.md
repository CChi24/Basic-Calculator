# A simple calculator built in C#

A straightforward calculator that does the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with whole numbers. 

## How it Works
The calculator is based on user input. The program will ask you for two numbers and an operation you want the program to do. As the program starts, it will ask you for the first number of your math problem. Upon entering the first number,the user will be introduced with a list of all the operations the calculator can do. 

All the user would do is choose the letter that matches the operation they want to do.
``
a) Addition
b) Subtraction
c) Multiplication
d) Division
```

Once the operation is selected, it will ask you for the second number of your math problem.

The program will verify that the user inputted **ONLY** numbers. After verifying the user-inputs, it will out the entered math problem and answer neatly.

If the user wishes to move on, pressing 'enter' will restart the calculator for a new math problem or the user can enter 'x' and leave.
